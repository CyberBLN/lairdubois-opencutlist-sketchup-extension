      This section will help you import parts (defined by a rectangular bounding
      box) from a [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)
      file into a model.

      You may then use the possibilities of *OpenCutList* for parts that have
      been generated by a software other than *Sketchup*.
